# smoker-status



## Design Decisions
- **split text into sentences immediately**
    - would be useful, but majority of texts are not full sentences (medical notes format), some would end up with one long sentence and the rest which are in sentence format are only one sentence (in a bigger dataset, this might just take up computational time and energy)
- **tokenizer**
    - great way to filter texts that have no information regarding smoker status (label as unknown immediately)
    - splitting texts in words, very useful for labels/smoker-statuses that have a key word that directly indicates what the patient's smoker status is (unknown and nonsmoker)
- **stop words**
    - since texts being used are medical notes, stop words provide a lot of meaning for shorter sentences (eg. pronouns, 'is' and its other conjugations, 'have' and its other conjugations, temporal words,  
- **dependency parsing**
    - not that great for medical notes format
    - mostly thought it would be useful for texts with negation
    - 'Does not drink, smoke, or do any drugs.' (row_id 26743) - with spacy's dependency parser, the negation's head is only drink, difficult to pick up that both 'smoke' and 'do any drugs' are included in negation ([Image Below](https://explosion.ai/demos/displacy?text=Does%20not%20drink%2C%20smoke%2C%20or%20do%20any%20drugs.&model=en_core_web_sm&cpu=1&cph=1)
![SpaCy Dependency Parsing](https://github.com/kateviloria/smoker-status/blob/main/images/dep-labels.png)
- **constituency parsing**
    - looks more promising compared to dependencies
    - 'Does not drink, smoke, or do any drugs.' (row_id 26743) - CoreNLP/Stanza parses it where mother node is sister to 'does not' in tree, captures negation 'drink', 'smoke', and 'do any drugs', need to figure out how to implement this! ([Image Below](https://corenlp.run/)

- **rule/processing order**
    - baseline - any texts that have no "smoke-related" rules are immediately labelled as Unknown (17708 labelled as Former Smoker but no information indicating so, at least for a program)
    - started with more definitive rules with clearer patterns, Nonsmoker labels
    - started differentiating Former Smoker and Smoker (where I found Former Smoker to have clearer/"easier" patterns to handle")


- **most difficult label: smoker**
    - considered implementing a rule that if it didn't have a label yet and it includes 'smoking', 'smoker', 'smoke' (more "present" words) to label as Smoker, but opted against to preserve precision

## Edge Cases
- any time a text speaks about smoking another substance
- 34464 - have both 'current smoker' and 'married current smoker'
- ppd rule won't work with the "** around numbers, if corrected should work
- finding 'due to smoking' could be applicable to past complications (hence, one of the last rules?)



## Concerns & Future Ideas
- how to separate medical notes based on headings
    - anything before ':' is a category and anything after is its contents?
- **negation** (especially when used in a list)
    - [this method](https://medium.com/@MansiKukreja/clinical-text-negation-handling-using-negspacy-and-scispacy-233ce69ab2ac) looks promising, leaning towards something to implement especially for larger datasets, did not implement due to time restrictions and prioritised as an edge case for dataset given
    - however, it is definitely a case that will appear again with a larger dataset
- smoke-related word as an indicator of smoke status only appearing once
    - some rules rely on a smoke-related word appearing only once (thought it would be okay for now since medical notes are meant to be concise and terse), especially the code/rules that find exact phrases 
- merging ppd and PPD rules
- building an FST pipeline based on rules written

- how are words which are wrapped in asterisks handled, if they are around information that's needed for analysis, should it be ignored (on non-existent dates I understand that it's probably treated as incorrect/not viable)
